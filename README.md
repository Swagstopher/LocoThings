### Introduction
Our project is called Whirsit, which is a play on the term “Where is it.” 
We went with implementing events with MapKit because we thought it was something fun, having a visual representation of events around us would teach us how to use iOS MapKit.
We were able to use a number of 3rd party libraries and APIs in our project to be able to deal with various functionality that we wanted to implement. 
We also added a number of social media functionality such as Facebook and Twitter which allow us to log in using your Facebook and Twitter account information and to be able to share things on it.
